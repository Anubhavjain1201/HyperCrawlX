## üìå Usage
HyperCrawlX operates as a web application. Users can interact with the crawler via its API endpoints.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Submit a Crawl Request
```http
POST http://hypercrawlx-lb-1875153021.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com/hypercrawlx/submitCrawlRequest
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "url": "<E-com website URL>"
}
```
#### ‚úÖ Response
```json
{
  "requestId": "<unique Id of the request>",
  "url": "<E-com website URL>"
}
```
This API submits a crawl request to the database with the given URL.
The URL is validated for structural correctness before submitting the request. If found altered, it is rejected and appropriate error is thrown to the user.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check Crawl Status
```http
GET http://hypercrawlx-lb-1875153021.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com/hypercrawlx/getRequestStatus/<request-Id>
```
#### ‚úÖ Response
```json
{
  "requestId": "<unique id of the request>",
  "status": "Completed",
  "url": "<E-com website URL>",
  "productUrlsCount": "<count-of-the-urls-found>",
  "productUrls": [
    "https://example.com/product1",
    "https://example.com/product2"
  ]
}
```
This API is used to check the status of the request. The status can be one of the following:
1. Queued
2. InProgress
3. Completed
4. Failed
